Welcome to KodeKloud GoLang Exercises :rocket:
This is your Visual Studio Code editor where you will practice developing your GoLang Programs.

To begin with :tropical_drink: relax and start working on the quizzes on the left.


Note: Some of the questions on the left would require you write go programs and/or run go commands. To do this, follow the below steps:

Create a file with .go extension. For example: main.go

Write your program

Open the terminal (see instructions below)

Mac users:
Ctrl + `

Windows/Linux users:
Ctrl + Shift + `

To run your program, type go run <name_of_the_file> in the terminal. For example - go run main.go.

You would be able to see the output/errors(if any) in the console.

All the best! :muscle:
